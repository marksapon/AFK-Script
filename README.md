## 📖 Description
**Template-Idle-Script** is a simple Python utility designed to prevent your system from going idle while you’re AFK. 
It works by pressing indicated or randomized buttons, which you can fully customize in the `main.py` script.

This is useful for scenarios such as:
- Keeping sessions active during long tasks
- Preventing automatic logouts
- Simulating minimal activity when AFK
